<h5>Welcome to the German Thesaurus! </h5>

<h3>This app is designed to allow users to discover new words that have similar meanings. This will allow users to enhance their German speaking, listening, reading, and writing, and broaden their range of German vocabulary. 

Anybody can view the website, including all words and synonyms. If you would like to contribute to the website and add words or synonyms, you must first create a username and password.

Once you log in with your username and password, you can create new word entries, and add as many synonyms to a new word as you like. Users are only able to edit and delete entries that they created - you cannot edit or delete entries that were created by another user. 

If you are looking at the code for this map, you will notice that there are a lot of front end React components. You can see an overall roadmap of the components below. This should help to visualize how props are passed down between various parent-to-child relationships.</h3>
